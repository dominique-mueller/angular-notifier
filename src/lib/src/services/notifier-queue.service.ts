/**
 * Notifier queue service
 *
 * In general, API calls don't get processed right away. Instead, we have to queue them up in order to prevent simultanious API calls
 * interfering with each other. This, at least in theory, is possible at any time. In particular, animations - which potentially overlap -
 * can cause changes in JS classes as well as affect the DOM. Therefore, the queue service takes all actions, puts them in a queue, and
 * processes them at the right time (which is when the previous action has been processed successfully).
 *
 * Technical sidenote:
 * An action looks pretty similar to the ones within the Flux / Redux pattern.
