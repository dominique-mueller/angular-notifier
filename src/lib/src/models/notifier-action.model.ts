 * In general, API calls don't get processed right away. Instead, we have to queue them up in order to prevent simultanious API calls
 * interfering with each other. This, at least in theory, is possible at any time, primarily due to overlapping animations.
 *
 * Technical sidenote:
 * An action looks pretty similar to the ones within the Flux / Redux pattern.
